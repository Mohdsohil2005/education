                            examines what education is and what aims it has. It also studies how it happens, what effects it has,
                            and how to improve it. It has many subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of education,
                            sociology of education, printing press in the 15th century made books more
                            widely available. This increased general literacy. Beginning in the 18th and 19th centuries, public
                            education became more important. It led to the worldwide process of making primary education available
                            to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age.</p>
